This is a Movies App made using React JS, React hooks like useState, useEffect and useContext , React Router and the imDb API.

Currently, this app has a functioning search bar which gives you list of movies and upon clicking on one movie, a separate card appears for a single movie which has details like plot, ratings, release date, art, and genres.

I am working on the favorites feature of this movie at this point in time. I have tried using methods like mixing useState and useEffect and using array methods like indexOf and concat methods alongside the localStorage, but it is interfering with the Router methods I placed in for the card. I am currently trying out another method which consists of React Router and state management using Redux.

Hence, I am working on a method that would not only enable this feature but also maintain its current features.

Images to the UI are the following.
